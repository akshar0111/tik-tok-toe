# tik-tok-toe
Tik tok toe A.K.A 'X and O' is my first command line game made with c++ for 2 players . It is made using basic concept of programming i wrote this code at my very early stages of programming.
to enter the x or o on a particular location enter the default location ie. a,b,c...,etc
the code is not so good because it was my first command line application ever written.
